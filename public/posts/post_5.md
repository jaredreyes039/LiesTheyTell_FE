## Endless Ocean: Luminous - What is it?

A fan of Capcom fork Arika's attention to detail, a 10 year old me found themselves enthralled in an ocean experience undelivered by any game before; an experience so invigorating, curiosity filled, and emotionally invested in its player's adventure. That game was *Endless Ocean 2: Blue World*.

For those unfamiliar with the titles, Endless Ocean is a diving adventure game centralized around exploration, discovery, and curiosity, whether it be morbid or scientific. From the grotesque goblin sharks of the Okeano's temple whom would stalk you with their protruding jaws, to the cute sea pigs minding themselves in the depths of the Zahab region, Endless Ocean is a chance for the player to experience the mystery and wonder of the ocean without the need for one! With many memorable moments across the two original games, including a marriage proposal to a catfish (a truly lovely affair), the Endless Ocean franchise has etched its branding and experience into the heart of every gamer who had the opportunity to encounter it. 15 years later, much like Pennywise returned for the children of Derry, Maine, I question if the return of a once beloved franchise is less than that of a welcome guest coming over for a good time, and more comparable to the delivery of a desecrated corpse upon your welcome mat with a note demanding $50 in ransom before more of your loved ones are killed.

A follow-up to the once thought dead franchise, *Endless Ocean: Luminous* boasts itself as an opportunity to re-experience the magic, mystery, and wonder of the original games in a new ocean referred to as the Veiled Sea. Offering options for a 'story' mode, solo diving, and diving online, the game comes at a hefty price of $50, in some cases doubling the price of its predecessor *Endless Ocean: Blue World*. With procedural maps that get tired faster than the player scanning their 5000th fish for the sake of a 10-second narrative clip, this once sprawling treasure of ocean game feels more like it should have remained buried in the sand, never to be salvaged again.

## The Good Before the Bad
Okay, yes, I am incredibly critical of this walking corpse that dares to call itself an Endless Ocean entry; however, before ripping that corpse apart like the Final Destination wood chipper, I want to take a moment to note where this game went right, where developers had taken heart, and where the experience can be enjoyable.

Firstly, while procedural generation is a curse on the land of gaming, and this game does not escape that by any means, there is a consistent sense of awe and wonder the first few dives. Finding myself starting around the NE corner of my own map, it didn't take long for me to be in wonder at the massive basking shark before me, to feel the fear of diving into blackened depths where megamouths and goblins sprawl; likewise, finding your first UML, the game's answer to mythical ocean creatures, is certainly a fun and unique experience. Not to mention the many, MANY direct and indirect references to games' past, such as Apollo the golden sunfish, or Gravedigger the oversized, ancient, and colorful giant isopod of the deep.

Along with the early sense of discovery in the first couple hours of playing, there is also something really addicting about making sure you scan every fish around you. See, in past Endless Ocean games, there was some method of interacting with the fish whether it was through focusing on them, or focusing on small shining spots among coral and rock where you could view smaller critters, there was always some method of getting up-close and personal with the ocean environment around you. In *Endless Ocean: Luminous* the feature for interacting with fish is consolidated to a scanning device that removes bioluminescent algae (I know, silly, but this is Endless Ocean we're talking about here, you could marry a catfish at one point don't forget that!) from the fish so you can get a better look at their true colors. Along with a better view of the creatures of the sea, the scanner also offers the chance to learn more about the animal, take a picture, and... well that's really it- you can add fish of a certain, I don't know *capacity*, to your team to dive with you, but as you'll read later I find that entire system a loss rather than a gain.

From the first couple hours of playing, there is little doubt that *Endless Ocean: Luminous* can offer players an ocean experience that fills a niche curiosity, provides a sense of looming mystery, and make heart-felt callbacks to the Endless Ocean lore of old; however, once the first few hours are over, Endless Ocean: Luminous takes off its deceptive mask and you soon realize you're playing nothing more than a glorified scanning simulator- replace the fish with barcodes and the ocean with a grocery store and you would still have the same damn game.

## Luminous Garbage Salvaged by Accident
If any of my compliments of *Endless Ocean: Lumnious* have in any way convinced you to consider trying the game out, I insist you wait out a little longer and consider the failures of this flop before you dish out 50 precious pelagos for the latest in fish scanning adventures.

First thing is first- the story, holy hell, the story. What happens when you combine lack of character customization, choppy and nonsensical dialogue, a man who only speaks in bubbles, and an emotionless AI voice? Well, if you're the management team at Arika, you get a video game you can use to scrape cash from the wallets of non-typical gamers who had hope their once beloved franchise had returned from the sea floor.

The story begins with an introduction to SERA, an AI-bot who is programmed to assist us in a quest to save the world coral- a unique coral growth in an undisclosed location that is responsible for maintaining the health of the Veiled Sea. The longest entry in the story I have experienced so far (I'll be damned if you think I am finishing this story anytime soon, you'll learn why shortly), Chapter 1-1 is essentially a tutorial level, and arguably the most flushed out story experience in the game- any chapter after this lasts at most about a minute, and is 95% dialogue between a useless side character, Daniel, who speaks in bubbles, and SERA. 
Thinking to yourself, "Okay, well maybe it gets better the more you progress and you haven't made it far enough," and to that I say ye, maybe, but I don't have plans to get far enough considering **every** chapter is locked behind a certain number of scans. Yes, that's right, you have to scan finish to progress the story, and not just like, 10 or 15 different species, no. To progress to my next chapter personally, I would require an extra 1000 scans (irrelevant if the species is already discovered or not), and there are only 578 fucking creatures in the entire game. Endless Ocean: Luminous took pride in being another entry into the amazing EO franchise, but should instead feel great shame for turning an already emotionless, bland narrative into a game of numbers.

Aside from the truly putrid and sad excuse for a story, Endless Ocean: Luminous sold itself as being a chance to explore unique seas that would be procedurally generated each dive- and boy does that feel like a cold, hard lie. While I am not denying that the game itself uses procedural generation for the maps, I am critical of Arika for making one of the biggest dumb fuck moves in all of gaming- make a game focused on scientific curiosity and discovery, but the map is random, the creatures are random, and the items are random. Throw away the scientific part of this critique if you'd like, sure games are games they don't need to be scientifically accurate (though the other entries most certainly tried), but the game is absolutely crippled by this random generation system. Need to fill out your encyclopedia? Good luck. Looking for a specific salvage item? May the odds be in your favor!

Want to beat the game? You have 99 random odds experiences to beat. Good. Fucking. Luck.

I can rant on forever about several other failures in this game, but one bit of critique I want to throw in is alleged, but I simply cannot rationalize otherwise- reused assets. Arika sat on the Endless Ocean titles for 15 years before bringing Luminous to light, and not only are there less features than a game made during the Wii era, but there is a feature that stands out to me in Luminous- sharks will still attack you. You see, for those who haven't played the original games, there was no real danger to the player other than running out of oxygen, and sometimes a predator (mostly sharks) would come up and smack you with their tail (to stay family friendly) and it would reduce your oxygen, ultimately shortening your dive time. In Endless Ocean: Luminous, there is no risk in any form to the player, and the oxygen bar does not even exist this time; however, there are select sharks that seem to have an attack animation- the same animation as previous games. Upon further inspection, a lot of the sharks with the attack animation, a useless animation in this particular entry, are sharks that were present in past games, and their models seem incredibly... familiar. Now, again this is alleged, but there are only two reasons I can think of for why these animations exist in Luminous: A. Arika's management team wanted the developers to include a system similar to the oxygen system in game's past, but later it was cut for some, likely stupid, reason, or B. They reused assets and couldn't be bothered to fix the animations at the very least.

While the former is a possibility, and I welcome Arika to come out and make clear as such, I feel strongly that the latter- the reuse of assets- is truly what happened. In evidence for this claim, aside from what I've already pointed out, I want to take a moment to focus on the dialogue and use of AI voice 'acting.' As mentioned earlier, SERA is our in-game AI assistant who guides the narrative with her soulless, monotone text-to-speech(TTS) voice. While the use of an AI assistant in games is most certainly nothing new, and the use of a TTS-esque voice just as common; however, rarely, if ever, have I personally experienced the use of a TTS to guide an entire story, but Arika felt that was completely okay, and totally not a cop-out for any form of actual voice acting. Hell, no voice acting was really present in games past, and even that would have been more preferable than the tension of a scene being ruined by stupid SERA going "Huh?" in the most monotone expression you can image. I argue further that SERA is not the only AI present in the game, as the dialogue has moments where it seems... strange. While this is again, alleged, I have to wonder- if TTS was used in place of voice acting, was AI used to write the already emotionless narrative thus far.

## Final Thoughts- Endless Ocean: Pollution
Ultimately, whether you were a fan of the previous Endless Ocean games and wondering if Luminous would scratch that itch, or new to Arika's long history of diving adventures and wondering if it's worth the price, I can confidently tell you that you should not allow your wallet near this game lest a gulper eel swallow your money. Endless Ocean: Luminous feels like a polluted ensemble to once phenomenal predecessors, and should be met with the upmost critique. From the lack of a true story, to the possible reuse of assets despite 15 years of room for planning, development, and the like, Arika not only failed to deliver an Endless Ocean experience, but failed to deliver a practical gaming experience at all, making a concept that was already quite simple, though incredibly enjoyable, into an idea so asinine, so uninspired and unsubstantiated, that the bones of a whale fall are less bare bones than the game Arika and Nintendo management are trying to sell you.

Save your $50, and let us cry together as Arika may have finally put the last nail into the coffin of a truly once-in-a-lifetime gaming experience. God speed Endless Ocean, may nobody desecrate your corpse the way Luminous did, again.
